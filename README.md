Project 6 - Feed Reader Testing
Dan Stuart

To access the project open index.html in a web browser.

It uses Jasmine v2.1.2 documentation for testing.

For this project, as instructed I wrote test suites and specs to test various funtions in the RSS Feed.

I added comments to each test and removed the TODO comments.

To complete this project I completed the JavaScript testing course. I replied upon all the other courses I took as part of the FEWD Nanodegree. Finally, I used the Jasmine 2.1.2 documentation as a resource.

Formatted code using my namesake http://www.danstools.com/ for making things purty.
